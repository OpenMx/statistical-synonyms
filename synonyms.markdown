1. [Structural Equation Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_equation_modeling)
 * RAM or LISREL model where the entries of A and S are numeric
2.  Extended SEM
 *  Model in which the RAM equivalent of A and S entries may be arbitrary algebras. 
3. [Definition variable]()
 * Anyvalue in an SEM that is replaced with a person-specific value such that it is different for every row or person.
4. [Multilevel model]()
 * Relational SEM (by analogy to the way in which a relational database links values in different tables. How OpenMx implements mulit-level
5. [Item Response Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Item_response_theory)
 * Item factor analysis (IFA)
